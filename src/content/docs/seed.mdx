A seed is a random number used by [Minecraft](/minecraft) to [generate](/worldgeneration) a [World](/world).

[Minecraft](/minecraft) accepts text as seeds as well, but it will be converted to a number using an hash algorithm. [Seed hashing](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Calculators/Seed_hashcode).

[Minecraft](/minecraft)'s [World generation](/worldgeneration) algorithm is deterministic, meaning starting from the same seed, the same [World](/world) will be generated.
If the [World generation](/worldgeneration) algorithm is updated between [Versions](/versions), starting from the same seed, a different [World](/world) will be generated.

The terrain generation part of the algorithm is the same for [Bedrock](/bedrockedition) and [Java](/javaedition) but [Structures](/structure) will be placed differently. [Seeds inspector](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Calculators/Chunkbase).

You can view the seed of the current [World](/world) of using the [Seed command](/commandseed).

```mcfunction
/seed
```
