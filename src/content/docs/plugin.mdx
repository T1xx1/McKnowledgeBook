Plugins are a [Project type](/projecttype).
Plugins are very similar to [Mods](/mod) but they enhance or modify the gameplay only on [Servers](/server).
Plugins do not need to be installed on player [Clients](/client) and they require a [Loader](/modloader) called [Plugin loader](/pluginloader) to work.
