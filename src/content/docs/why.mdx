[Minecraft](/minecraft) is my favourite game, and also being passionate about programming, I inevitably fell in love with [Minecraft modding](/modding) content of any kind.

Unfortunately, when I first tried to approach the modding environment, I couldn't find good resources, examples, or tutorials with the right information I needed to start and progress into my journey.

The situation is not easy, [Minecraft's codebase is not open source](/minecraftsobfuscatedcodebase), the Minecraft modding community is not very big compared to the entire Minecraft player base and all the information is scattered across different sites and Discord servers, not well explained if even present or outdated given the many breaking changes every [Minecraft version](/versions) introduces. Not including the terrible user experience, many of those sites make you go through just to get the right data.

The McKnowledgeBook project aims to improve the accessibility and the quality of Minecraft modding information using the right [technologies](/tech) for the web, with a bit of regard to [web design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design) and [UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience), concepts, I noticed, Java programmers are not really familiar with.

I've also decided to create these docs in the first place for me, because I needed a place to archive all the information I was acquiring and also to describe some situations for my other project [Modpackker](/modpackker), and it felt a waste of energy and time if I just kept everything for myself.

I'm not a programming god, I'm just a web dev, and I still don't understand many things about the modding environment. If you find errors or problems, feel free to make changes by clicking the "Edit page" button at the end of every page, [contribute using the OSS repo](https://github.com/t1xx1/mcknowledgebook) or contact me through my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/gaDqYhxyzB). I'm open to every suggestion.

## How about the [Minecraft Wiki](/minecraftwiki)?

The Minecraft Wiki is the best place to look up information about [Minecraft](/minecraft), but only if we're talking about the [Vanilla](/vanilla) [Gameplay](/gameplay). It has some pages about modding, like for [mods](https://minecraft.wiki/mod), [datapacks](https://minecraft.wiki/data_pack) and [resource packs](https://minecraft.wiki/resource_pack), but no information about how modding actually works with [Loaders](/loader), [Launchers](/launcher), and the other [Project types](/projecttype), nor, which are the best [Tools](/tools) and best practices for modding.

The Minecraft wiki is also kinda considered the "official" source of information about Minecraft, and I think it's better if it only deals with Vanilla part of things. Although the Minecraft Wiki doesn't contain much information about modding, I'm still going to reference it heavily as a source of information for Vanilla, where modding is, of course, based on.
