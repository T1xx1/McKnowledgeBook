[Minecraft](/minecraft) is my favourite game, and also being passioned about programming, I inevitably fell in love with [Minecraft modding](/modding) content of any kind.

Unfortunately, when I first tried to approach the modding environment I couldn't find good resources, examples or tutorials with the right information I needed to start and progress into my journey.

The situation is not easy, [Minecraft's codebase is not open source](/minecraftsobfuscatedcodebase), the Minecraft modding community is not very big compared to the entire Minecraft player base and all the information is scattered across different sites and Discord servers, not well explained if even present or outdated given the many breaking changes every [Minecraft version](/versions) introduces. Not including the terrible user experience many of those sites make you go through, just to get the right data.

This project aims to improve the accessibility and the quality of Minecraft content in particular for modding information. Using the right [technologies](/tech) for the web, with a bit of regard to [web design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design) and [UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience), concepts I've seen Java programmers are not really familiar with.
I've also decided to create these docs in the first place for me, because I needed I place to archive all the information I was acquiring and also the describe some situation for my other Minecraft project [Modpackker](https://modpackker.vercel.app) and it felt a waste of energy and time if I would kept everything for myself.

I'm not a programming god, I'm just a web dev, and I still don't understand many things about the modding environment. If you find errors or problems feel free to make changes (clicking the "Edit page" button at the end of every page) and [contribute](https://github.com/t1xx1/mcknowledgebook) or contact me through my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/gaDqYhxyzB). I'm open to every suggestions.
