Fabric is a [Mod loader](/modloader) created to be a lightweight alternative to [Forge](/forge) that was becoming too big and slow.

[Forge](/forge) and [NeoForge](/neoforge) [Mods](/mod) cannot be run on Fabric, since the Fabric loader was completely written from scratch and its codebase has no relation with [Forge](/forge)'s one.

:::note
In the same way Fabric [Mods](/mod) cannot not natively run or [NeoForge](/neoforge).

[Sinytra connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) is an awesome project that tries to bridge the gap between these two mod loaders mapping Fabric APIs to [NeoForge](/neoforge).
The only downside, is the additional processing cost of the intermediate Sinytra's layer between the Fabric [Mod](/mod) and [NeoForge](/neoforge).
:::

Due to an internal dispute in the Fabric core team, some members decided to split from it, fork Fabric and create the [Quilt](/quilt) loader.
