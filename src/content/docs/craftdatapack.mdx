## Prerequisites

- Knowledge about [Datapacks](/datapack)
- Be sure that what you want to achieve is possible with [Datapacks](/datapack). [Datapack VS mods](/datapackvsmod)
- A little knowledge about [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)
- A text editor like notepad or a code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)

## Guide

<Steps>

1.  Create a new folder with the name of your datapack and open it in your editor

    :::note
    Consider creating your datapack directly inside a [Minecraft](/minecraft) world save ([Datapack folder location](/datapack#datapack-store-location)) to quickly test while developing and later export it in a better place.

    Remember to execute `/reload` after any datapack change to load the new chages into the game without exiting the world.
    :::

2.  In the root folder of your datapack create a

    #### `pack.mcmeta`

    The `pack.mcmeta` describes information about your datapack

    ```json
    // pack.mcmeta
    {
    	"pack": {
    		"description": "This is the description of your datapack",
    		"pack_format": 8,
    		"supported_formats": [8, 9]
    	}
    }
    ```

    The `description` field can use [Formatting codes](/formattingcode).

    The `pack_format` field is the version of the datapack format. This field is related to the [Minecraft](/minecraft) [Version](/versions) you want your datapack to be compatible with. Check out which [Datapack versions](/datapack#datapack-versions) you should set.

    :::note
    Starting from [`25w21a`](/25w21a), datapacks can be easily created with the right [Datapack version](/datapack#datapack-versions), in game, with the `/datapack create <id> <name>` [Command](/command).
    :::

    New [Minecraft](/minecraft) [Versions](/versions) may introduce new features to datapacks by bumping the [Datapack version](/datapack#datapack-versions). Starting from `1.20.2`, if your datapack uses functionalities that haven't been changed in the version bump, it's possible to set the `supported_formats` field to make your datapack compatible with new [Minecraft](/minecraft) [Versions](/versions) without changing the code nor the `pack_format` field.
    Set the first number of the `supported_formats` field to the lowest [Datapack version](/datapack#datapack-versions) you support, and the second number to the highest [Datapack version](/datapack#datapack-versions) you support.
    If your datapack uses functionalities that have been affected by the version bump, you have to bump you `pack_format` field and also update the code according to the chages made.

    :::note
    I personally recommend to set the lowest supported version to the same version of `pack_format` and not use older versions than the "base" version your developing you datapack for.
    :::

    #### `pack.png`

    The `pack.png` is the icon that will be displayed in the datapack selection menu. It's optional and it has to be a square

3.  Create a `data` folder

	This folder will contain all the code of your datapack organized in namespaces
	
	For example if you want to change some [Minecraft](/minecraft) feature create a `minecraft` folder namespace and the code in this folder will overwrite the corrisponding file inside of [Minecraft](/minecraft) [Vanilla](/vanilla).
	
	:::note
	You can inspect [Minecraft](/minecraft) [Vanilla](/vanilla) files here [Mc Assets](https://mcasset.cloud)
	:::

	If you want to add new feature create a new folder namespace and the files in this folder will be added to the base game.

	:::note
	If your playing with a [Modpack](/modpack) be sure that the namespace your choosing it's not used anywhere else otherwise you are still going to be overwriting other [Mods](/mod) or [Datapacks](/datapack) functionalities.
	:::

	:::note
	Namespaces can also be used to orginaze your code with datapacks with a lot of features.
	:::

	So far your datapack should look something like this

	<FileTree>
	- \<datapack\>
		- pack.mcmeta
		- pack.png
		- data
			- minecraft
				- ...
			- \<namespace\>
				- ...
			- \<namespace2\>
				- ...
	</FileTree>

4. Add features to your datapack

	- [Advancements](/datapackadvancement)
	- [Dimensions](/datapackdimension)
	- [Enchantments](/datapackenchantment)
	- [Functions](/datapackfunction)
	- [Loot tables (Drops)](/datapackloottable)
	- [Predicates](/datapackpredicate)
	- [Recipes](/datapackrecipe)
	- [Structures](/datapackstructure)
	- [Tags](/datapacktag)
	- [World generation](/datapackworldgeneration)

5. Done
	
	:::note
	[Datapacks](/datapack) folder can also be zipped to save space and reduce loading time.

## Examples

Here's some code examples of datapacks I've made:

- [Beehaviour](https://github.com/cristian-5/Beehaviour)
- [Delicate](https://github.com/T1xx1/Delicate)
- [BE boats](https://github.com/T1xx1/Beboats)

## Generators

Since [Datapacks](/datapack) are static files, they can also be generated with online tools like [Crafting](https://crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca) or [Misode](https://misode.github.io).
When aiming for a more complex datapack, maybe a hybrid or complete manual approach is better.
Keep in mind that sometimes these generators won't have the latest version right away or a niche snapshot since the datapack syntax can change a lot with new [Versions](/versions).
