:::tip[New]
Since [`25w21a`](/25w21a) datapacks can be easily created, with the right datapack version, in game with `/datapack create <id> <name>`  [Command](/command).
:::

...

Here's some code examples of datapacks I've made:
- [Beehaviour](https://github.com/cristian-5/Beehaviour)
- [Delicate](https://github.com/T1xx1/Delicate)
- [BE boats](https://github.com/T1xx1/Beboats)

## Generators
Since datapacks are most JSON files they can be generated with online tools like [Crafting](https://crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca) or [Misode](https://misode.github.io).
When aiming for a more complex datapack maybe a hybrid or complete manual approach it's better.
Keep in mind that sometimes these generators won't have the latest version right away or a niece snapshot since the datapack syntax has been changing a lot through the years.
