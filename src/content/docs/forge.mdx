Forge was one of first [Mod loaders](/modloader) created for [Minecraft](/minecraft).

Over the years the Forge team keep adding small features to the loader but that weren't actually really impactful on the modding space, resulting in Forge being bigger program, felt as bloated and impacted on load performance especially for not very powerful computers.
To create a better experience for the modding space some developers created the [Fabric](/fabric) loader was a lightweight mod loader.

Due to an internal dispute with project lead some members of the core team decided to split from it, fork Forge and create a new loader [NeoForge](/neoforge).
