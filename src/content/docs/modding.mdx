Modding is the process of altering [Minecraft](/minecraft)'s default experience to add or change features, game mechanics, and [Gameplay](/gameplay).

[Mods](/mod) and other [Project types](/projecttype) have greatly extended the already infinite possibilities of [Minecraft](/minecraft).
Today, modding has become much easier than in past, but it's still a hard thing to do because [Minecraft](/minecraft) is not designed to allow modifications apart from [Resource packs](/resourcepack) and [Datapacks](/datapack).

[Datapacks](/datapack) can extend the [Vanilla](/vanilla) experience, but are not suitable to add new great things, and without [Loaders](/loader) modding would not be possible.
