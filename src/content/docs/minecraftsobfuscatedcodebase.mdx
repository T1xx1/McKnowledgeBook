[Minecraft](/minecraft)'s codebase isn't [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) therefore we cannot see how it really works which is fundamental for [modding](/modding).

The code that runs on our computers is not the source code but is [compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) and [obfuscated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)).
> In software development, obfuscation is the practice of creating source or machine code that is intentionally difficult for humans or computers to understand

[Mod loaders](/modloader) creators had to reverse engineer the compiled and obfuscated code, a very hard and tidious task, to create mappings: a human readble code format that mod creators can use that calls Minecraft native code.
