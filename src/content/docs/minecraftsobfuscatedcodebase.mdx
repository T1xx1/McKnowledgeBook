Minecraft's codebase isn't open source therefore we cannot see how it really works which is fundamental for [modding](/modding).
We could try and take the code that runs on our [Clients](/client) but unfortunately that code is [compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) and [obfuscated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)).
> In software development, obfuscation is the practice of creating source or machine code that is intentionally difficult for humans or computers to understand

There's no other way to solve this problem to obtain the original source code so [ModLoaders](/modloader) creators had to reverse engineer the compiled and obfuscated, a very hard and tidious task so everybody in the modding community could create mods.
