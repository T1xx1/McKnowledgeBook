[Mods](/mcwiki/mod) and other [Project types](/mcwiki/projecttype) has greatly extended the already infinite gameplay possibilities of [Minecraft](/mcwiki/minecraft).
Today modding [Minecraft](/mcwiki/minecraft) has become mush easier than in the past but its still a hard thing to do because [Minecraft](/mcwiki/minecraft) was not designed to allow modifications. [Resource packs](/mcwiki/resourcepack) and [Datapacks](/mcwiki/datapack) can extend the default experience but they can only interact with a small part of the [Vanilla](/mcwiki/vanilla) engine and without [Loaders](/mcwiki/loader) Minecraft modding would not be possible.
