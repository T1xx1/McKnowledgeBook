## [Sodium](https://modpackker.vercel.app/project/sodium)

- Use a compact format of world geometry than vanilla [Minecraft](/minecraft) reducing the amount of video memory
- Eliminates calculation of geometry when out of sight
- Rewrites chunk generation and rendering system resulting in much faster [World generation](/worldgeneration)
- Custom threading implementation for multi-core processors reducing lag when placing and breaking blocks
- Disables out of sight animated textures for faster texture rendering
- Tweaks light source which can take up a lot of computing power

:::note
Sodium doesn't modify game mechanics so it's allowed in speed runs
:::

## [VulkanMod](/vulkanmod)

- Improved low level GPU language

:::note
Currently the VulkanMod is not compatible with Sodium and ImmediatelyFast
:::

## [Dynamic FPS](https://modpackker.vercel.app/project/dynamic-fps)
