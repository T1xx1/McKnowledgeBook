- Eliminates calculation of geometry when out of sight
- Rewrites chunk generation and rendering system resulting in much faster [World generation](/worldgeneration)
- Custom threading implementation for multi-core processors reducing lag when placing and breaking blocks
- Disables out of sight animated textures for faster texture rendering
- Tweaks light source which can take up a lot of computing power

:::note
Sodium doesn't modify game mechanics so it's allowed in speed runs
