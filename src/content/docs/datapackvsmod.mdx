| [Datapack](/datapack)                                                                                                 | [Mod](/mod)                                                                                        |

| No setup is needed to create a datapack                                                                               | A development environment with an IDE is required to create [Mods](/mod)                           |
| `txt`, images, `json` files and [Minecraft](/minecraft) commands                                                      | [Java](https://www.java.com/it/) scripts                                                           |
| Datapacks can be streamed from [Servers](/server) worlds and you don't have to install them on your [Client](/client) | Everyone has to install required [Mods](/mod) from the [Server](/server) to be able to join        |
| Datapacks run on the [Vanilla](/vanilla) engine                                                                       | [Mods](/mod) require [Mod loaders](/modloader)                                                     |
| Limited possibilities defined by the [Vanilla](/vanilla) engine                                                       | "Infinite" possibilities                                                                           |
| Performing updates it's easier                                                                                        | Updates are difficult to perform as [Mod loaders](/modloader) have to frequently change their APIs |
