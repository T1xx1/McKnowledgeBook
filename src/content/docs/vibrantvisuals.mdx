:::note
   Minecraft developers have created a dedicated [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2x2p2n8) for Vibrant
   visuals development. It's read only but worth joining to get the latest
   insight on the project.
:::

Vibrant visuals are [Minecraft](/minecraft)'s new built in [Shaders](/shader).

## [Modding](/modding)
Vibrant visuals may impact the current state of the modding process and gameplay in particular for [Shaders](/shader).

Minecraft's developers intend to rewrite some parts of the rendering process adding more graphic specific code to adapt and prepare the game for Vibrant visuals. [Shaders](/shader) will become way better, less laggy and less CPU costly because they will be supported by the [Vanilla](/vanilla) engine and maybe [Shader loaders](/shaderloader) will not be required anymore.

In general all [Mods](/mod) will benefit with a faster and better graphic experience.
