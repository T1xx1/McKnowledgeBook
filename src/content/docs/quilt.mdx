Quilt is a [Mod loader](/modloader), forked from [Fabric](/fabric) due an internal dispute in core team.

Technically, [Mods](/mod) written for [Fabric](/fabric) could run on Quilt too without additional modifications, but it doesn't always works.

## Bindings

<Bindings client:load data={quiltBindings} />
