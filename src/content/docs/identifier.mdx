Identifiers are a way to declare and identify elements in [Minecraft](/minecraft) like items, block or entities.

Identifier can be made with lowercase letters (abc...), numbers (123...), underscore (\_), hyphen (-) and dot (.).

Identifiers have this structure `namespace:name`, where the `namespace` is the name of the folder from the [Datapack](/datapack) or [Mod](/mod) where the item is located, and the `name` is the name of the `.json` file where the resource is declared.

For exmaple, if I want to obtain a glass block using [Commands](/command) I would type this:

```mcfunction
/give @s minecraft:glass
```

`minecraft:glass` is the identifier of the glass block and `minecraft` is, of course, the namespace of [Vanilla](/vanilla) items.

:::note
The `minecraft` namespace can be omitted, but it's good practice to be very specific when working with [Datapacks](/datapack) or [Mods](/mod), and thefore multiple namespaces.
