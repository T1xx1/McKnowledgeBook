The VulkanMod is a performance optimization mod that uses the Vulkan API.

Vulkan is a cross-platform API for 3D graphics. It's designed to allow developers have more control over the GPU than older standards like [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL) with low-level API calls. It supports a wide variety of CPUs and multi-core CPUs, GPUs and operating system.

Windows 10 and 11 both currently support Vulkan `1.2`.

Vulkan is developed by the [Khronos Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khronos_Group).
