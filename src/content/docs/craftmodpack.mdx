	:::note
	Incompatible projects will not be included in your modpack, and you can remove them if you want, but keeping them in will make thing easier when they'll get an update and become compatible
	:::

6. When you're satisfied with your modpack, click "Export", and chose the format

	:::note
	Your modpack is automatically saved in your account and displayed in your dashboard
	:::

</Steps>

:::note
Adding many [Mods](/mod) and [Datapacks](/datapack) to a [Modpack](/modpack) may create compatibility issues during gameplay.
Those problems can be resolved by creating a [custom datapack](/craftdatapack).
