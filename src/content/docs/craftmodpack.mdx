5. Check if your projects are compatible using the editor

	:::note
	Incompatible projects will not be included in your modpack, you can remove them if you want, but keeping them in will make things easier when they'll get an update and become compatible. In this case toggle the switch on the right to disable them.

6. When you're satisfied with your modpack, click "Export", and chose the format

	:::note
	Your modpack is automatically saved in your account and displayed in your dashboard
	:::

</Steps>

:::note
Adding many [Mods](/mod) and [Datapacks](/datapack) to a [Modpack](/modpack) may create compatibility issues during [Gameplay](/gameplay).
Those problems can only be resolved by creating a [custom datapack](/craftdatapack).
